{"movie": [{"movie_name": "deadpool", "review": ["i really really liked deadpool and you know what i didnt expect to seriously i was never a fan of the character in the sense that i hardly knew anything about him and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers still i remained interested in the film i just never expected it to actually be good   until the reviews arrived after most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise i went in cautiously optimistic but still fully prepared to hate the filmthe first thing i noticed was how inventive the storytelling is the film throws you into the action from the first moment literally the very first moment and then it goes back and forth in brilliant and unexpected ways to slowly unspool the story of this insane   but oddly charming   antihero flashbacks and fast forwards can be annoying as hell but when done right they can help render even a somewhat simple story fresh and exciting and thats exactly how deadpool felt to me right from the start like a fresh if somewhat dirty jolt of energythe action itself is beautifully designed employing playful visuals and using pretty much every camera technique available it never feels repetitive and the pacing is close to perfection but and that was probably the key to me liking the film so much theres a beating heart underneath all the action and carnage and that has a lot to do with how brilliantly ryan reynolds portrays the character and the great chemistry he has with co star morena baccarin what came as a complete surprise to me was how unabashedly romantic deadpool is the love story in this film is probably the most sincere ive ever seen in a superhero movie and it gives the film the strong emotional core which so many of these movies lackthe humor which i initially feared would just be non stop juvenile wisecracks and soon become distracting also works surprisingly well not every line or every joke lands   but thats the beauty of this character they dont really need to deadpool cant help himself as long as hes able to breathe hell crack wise and make fun of himself and those around him its a clinical condition hes not a stand up comedian whose jokes need to land hes a madman albeit a very entertaining one and the comedy in his case is born out of tragedydespite all my praise its not a perfect film the villain in this revenge tale could be more memorable and the story itself is a bit too derivative to really do its highly unconventional protagonist he insists hes not a hero justice but its a damn good first entry in a franchise that will hopefully explore the character and his world to a much larger extent in the sequels and its actually a very important film for another reason if deadpool is a financial success   which at this point is already clear it will be   this could play a vital role in how studios henceforth view the financial prospects of r rated superhero films and well hopefully see more of them in the futuremany people might feel different   and i respect their opinion   but ive grown tired of the entirely bloodless cgi overkill in all those 200 million productions where even the most terrible villains talk like mormon schoolgirls i mean theres a gigantic audience out there that is over the age of 18 loves to read comic books and can absolutely handle real world language real world sex and real world violence in superhero movies this genre is so diverse its ridiculous to believe just because comic books have pictures in them all film adaptations   regardless of the material   must automatically be made for kids in order to be successfulas it is i think deadpool   a dirty funny sexy and violent film which is decidedly not for kids   just proved my point perfectly 8 stars out of 10", "deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference little credit should be given to 20th century fox as they had zero faith in the success of a deadpool movie to put things into perspective ryan reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when blade trinity was released reynolds and co went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by reynolds because fox had no intentions to release it to the public finally after years and years of begging to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public fox didnt even tell reynolds and co that the film was greenlit they had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians if that sounds bad fox even cut their budget by $7 million at the last minute which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that im sure wouldve been great to seedeadpool now has the biggest opening weekend in the month of february surpassing fifty shades of grey the biggest opening weekend for 20th century fox surpassing all the x men films and the biggest opening weekend for an r rated film ever surpassing the matrix reloaded with all that being said deadpool is a hilariously entertaining film that works mainly because of reynolds himself his comedic skills pay off gloriously as the titular character who gives so many quips in one instance that some jokes will be missed of course credit should be given to the writers too aka the real heroes here and its impressive that this is tim millers directorial debut the action sequences and pacing are so good that youd think this came from a veteran directorfrom the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending deadpool constantly upends clich\u00e9s and tropes youre used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years whats great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it jokes about pedophilia pegging and sex run rampant but its never really dark despite the mature subject matter on top of that its also very refreshing to see a pansexual superhero in such a big studio film its unheard of these days fox and other studios learn from this success its not the fact that a hard r rated film can do well its that deadpool also happens to be very good most likely because you fox actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted", "at first glance deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by marvel but once those hilarious intro credits show up you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years the first thing that is unique about this film is the characters in typical superhero films the characters are stiff and super serious in deadpool the characters are filled with personality and can range from the serious francis to the silly deadpool giving this a parody like feel in a good wayalso what is different is that this is a story of revenge rather then saving the city world universe that is seen in every single superhero film also the tone of film is more comic then dark thanks to the fantastic humor of all kinds from slapstick to dirty to just plain silly this film just does not stop the laughs i laughed 20  30 times in my second watch as for being an origin story i can say that the backstory placements were well done equally as funny and explains only what is important in understanding the story final rating 10 10 this is a great nominee for movie of the year and one of the greatest comedies ever mad", "deadpool is a very fun movie after the characterization of deadpool i saw in x men origins wolverine i never wanted a deadpool movie i got one it didnt disappoint but at the same time i feel it is one of the most over praised movies of all times i dont hate this movie at all but at the same time i dont like it either the majority of it is entertaining what works first and foremost the character   deadpool this hilarious and goofy badass merc with a mouth is something i really liked his jokes punchlines and fourthwall breaking humor lands perfectly secondly the non linear storytelling if this movie had a linear storytelling it wouldnt have been half as entertaining as it is thirdly the hilarious character moments and slapstick comedy the character interaction between deadpool and some of the x men and francis and dopinder and negasonic are funny and entertaining   sometimes involving some slapsticky things which are grose and graphic but solely due to deadpools mutation makes it funny the fourth wall break   take this element out the movie is totally incomplete action scenes   pretty good especially the first one but thats all i liked about it what bothered a lot of things it takes too much of liberty due to the fourth wall breaking elements it has it uses a number of movie clich\u00e9s of the superhero genre and mock them by breaking the fourth wall that surely is hilarious but doesnt change the fact that the movie had a lazy writing also the plot is a typical superhero origins stuff a little more romantic though none of the plotlines were exciting or intriguing it felt good just because of the way the character deadpool was written else every one of them were simply clich\u00e9d materials it felt as if we had to accept whatever was shoved down our throats and we had all the fourth wall breaks to cover it up that felt like an overconfidence in the part of the makers also one particular scene involving deadpool and the villain feels too stretched if it wasnt there we wont have a third act why are people intentionally looking over these i am completely surprised to see a bunch of people saying this is the greatest superhero film ever it isnt bad and doesnt suck thats all i can name a whole lot of superhero movies much better than this   the dark knight 2008 spider man 2002  spider man 2 2004 logan 2017 avengers infinity war 2018 deadpool 2 2018 captain america civil war 2016 x men first class 2011 x men days of future past 2014 x men 2000 batman begins 2005 the dark knight rises 2012 unbreakable 2000 the avengers 2012 wonder woman 2017 x2 x men united 2003 thor ragnarok 2017 etc so i absolutely dont feel that it being called the greatest superhero film is apt in the end it is essential to say that ryan reynolds is absolutely great as wade wilson deadpool no one should replace him as deadpoolscore  63 10grade  b label  entertaining for single or occasional view", "if anyone else could be cast to play deadpool he certainly doesnt exist in this universe after ryan reynoldss dramatic failure in the green lantern film he has returned to the comic book world reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed and witty anti hero i mean he is just superb he completely owns the role and gives a fantastic performance if robert downey jr is iron man then ryan reynolds is deadpool he is also such a liveable character and by the end of the film i genuinely cared about deadpool i never thought id say that all of the performances are great no one holds a candle to reynolds but i will say not one person was miscast heredeadpool is a unique film and a huge gamble both marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk this is a beloved character and his world is very different than other marvel films right off the bat this film is consciously self aware it knows its a comic book film with comic book characters and it actually exploits it many times deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what were all thinking it was so different and it worked so very well the narrative itself is also different its very non linear the events of the film dont play out in a normal straight narrativeone of the trademarks nay the trademark of deadpool is his sense of humour this film is by far one of the most hysterical films i have seen in some time the writing is so perfect so sharp and so full of witty banter and thankfully it all works not one joke that i remember fell flat the film had me laughing constantly from the opening credits all the way to the after credits sceneas for the action its also very satisfying many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work for whatever reason many modern action films are using shaky cam instead of clear steady shots the dp will go hand held and shake the camera violently the worst example in recent memory of this is taken 3 thankfully there are films like this and others that know exactly how to do a good action scene director tim miller and cinematographer ken seng do a brilliant job creating slick good looking action not only is the action brutal and extremely bloody its just co clear and well handled the fights are really great here i couldnt help but be reminded of tarantinos kill bill films while watching deadpool they are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenessitting in the cinema the inner critic in me struggled internally i kept thinking afterwards about the film what were the flaws i dont often see a film without pointing out the negatives even films i really like or even love have flaws im certain that if one sits and picks this apart you will eventually find some flaws perhaps the overall story is paper thin perhaps the villain wasnt very compelling as character then again ajax was honestly serviceable ed skrein gave a great performance and by the end you really hate the bastard hes a generic or a dick british villain and the film makes fun of thatdeadpool and guardians of the galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off big time as a film its nearly perfect the film does exactly what it needed to do and more it introduces deadpool sets up his character and gets you to like him if you didnt already the non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film everything about this film was different and unique its self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well really well the direction is great ryan reynolds is phenomenal and the script is fantastic", "i am aware that to many people especially those unfamiliar with deadpool comic or marvel comics at all this movie would seem too gory unnecessary brutal and excessively violent but this movie is a comedy where its main protagonist deadpool should be perceived as a comedian and ryan reynolds did an excellent job representing this characterthe story of deadpool isnt complex or profound   and it wasnt meant to be this movie is all about fun and entertainment abundant with action jokes blood and foul language therefore it is not suitable for children i grew tired of people thinking that movies based on comics are intended for children onlyrelated to that i believe that many marvel movies could have been far more successful if they didnt refrain from gory scenes i am sorry but if you want to make a serious combat based movie and you make it without blood than that movie will be all but seriousthat is why i see deadpool as a refreshment nowadays many writers and directors are too worried about political correctness in their movies that really stifles creativity and that is why today we have so many movies with great ideas but poor realizationthus to me deadpool was a very pleasant surprise i had fun watching it and i intend to watch it again some time soon", "firstly i would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with one star because the movie had foul language and sex scenes or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid dead pool is rated r and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not with that being said i will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic ryan reynolds nailed this role if you are easily offended by violence language or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie", "ive said it in other reviews that no movie is perfect there arent any movies that actually deserve a perfect score but what if you were a dead pool fan and you heard that an actor that was a huge fan too and had already played the character once with horrible results wished for redemption what if you wanted a comic book movie that would rise above the whole pg 13 cesspool far too many movies are thrown into these days what character would be completely drowned in such a pool wolverine somehow treads that water even with a metal skeleton though he did finally get unleashed with an r rated send off film possibly partly thanks to this movie but deadpool could never have been done right in a pg 13 movie the merc with the mouth had to have his lips sowed shut the first go round and after that well most fans would say he was never truly deadpool including the man who played himryan reynolds deserves significant praise for his persistent pursuit of playing a real deadpool and boy does he the r rating took the comic book genre to a sparkly place i wish it would have gone to years ago oh yeah is this movie satisfying for that alone and reynolds nails it possibly thanks to the fact that he actually caredbut how good is it as a movie aside from all that well i gave it a ten it might be more of a nine out of ten movie if it wasnt so special it was the first r rated movie of its kind and it proved to the people and the studios that it could be extremely successful even with that rating thank you deadpool you deserve an extra star for that alone", "deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the x men franchise where the merc with the mouth seeks revenge in a humorous waywade wilson is a mercenary who spends his time in new york

and they reconcile by kissingin a post credits scene deadpool urges the audience to leave and go home then announces that there will be a sequel involving cable", "let me say at the very beginning of this review i loathe super hero movies i can not stress that point enough for me watching anyone of the countless driveling movies which have been pumped out by studios in the name of entertainment over the past decade is for me akin to having teeth pulled painful to say the least my friends however are addicted to every single bombastic franchise and through sufferance ive endured countless hours of mind numbing boredom watching yet more lycra clad numpties saving the earth from ridiculous threat there are of course exceptions to the above the dark knight the original x meni was once again convinced that spending an evening with chums watching deadpool would be an excellent waste of my time i envisaged 15 minutes of feigned interest followed by an hour 45 of updating my email and some cheeky online shopping well that new morphy richards kettle and toaster are still waiting for me to purchase as low and behold shock of all shocks this film is bloody marvellous bloody hold your knickers cause they are about to get blown off marvellousthe dialogue is witty sincere and delivered by every single actor with a naturalism which seems more like improvised off the cuff genius than drab scripted nonsensethe pacing of the movie is excellent it held my interest through its entiretythe actions scenes directed with the skill of a more seasoned directori was so pleased that for once i was being forced to watch a movie that treated me like an adult with adult humour and themes made for adults not for grown children masquerading as adultsthis film is a perfect storm just everything is right i look forward to my great surprise to any squeals", "in a world where superhero movies are often unnecessarily dark and gritty #deadpool comes along and shows you how its done its the perfect combo of action comedy and r rating that really dont give two sh*ts about your sensitivity do you remember that warm blueberry pie that your grandma made for you when you were younger or the time you saw that girl youve been crushing on during chemistry class in high school well you can throw those memories out the window now and make way for deadpoolryan reynolds plays a skilled special forces operative turned mercenary wade wilson morena baccarin plays his hot ass girlfriend vanessa this woman is the embodiment of sexy they are a match made in marvel comics heaven but their dream is crushed upon discovering that wilson has cancer all over a situation that forces him to sign up to a rogue experiment that subjects him to accelerated healing powers the lab is run by francis ajax ed skrein who himself is a bit of a mutant the brutal experiments turn wade wilson into an ugly dude but an indestructible one hes now bent on revenge especially after ajax kidnaps vanessa meanwhile colossus and negasonic teenage warhead from the x men try their best to convince deadpool to join their team and become one of the good guys but lets face it that aint deadpools style the first people we have to thank of course would be the original comic book writers creators fabian nicieza and rob liefeld who brilliantly gave us this very unique superhero unlike any other the next people in line to thank are screenwriters rhett reese and paul wernick who remind us why we loved zombieland back in 2009 they inject the same brand of humor into deadpool and keep the character faithful to the comic books yes by that i mean none of that crap version of wade wilson in x men origins wolverine anymore applause goes to tim miller as well what a helluva feature directorial debut clearly when you give a superhero project to a geek who loves the material and knows it inside out if you just let him run with it its like giving gi joe toys to a kid who can name them all by heart great things can happenfor those of you who are not familiar with deadpool just a heads up this movie just like the comics is extremely over the top graphic in terms of sex violence and humor and thats exactly how we like it wade wilson is a chatterbox he talks a lot to some this can get annoying while to the rest its music to our ears mainly because of the sh*t he says and he breaks fourth wall meaning hell talk to you the audience but whats even more epic than that is the fact that he is aware of the universe that hes in and the universe that youre in and those two collide in the most epic way possible so ryan reynolds character wade wilson makes fun of ryan reynolds the actor and also mocks ryan reynolds previous poor decisions like green lantern and people magazines sexiest man alive this movie is a dream come true for those of you hardcore fans it even has what i think is one of the greatest most hilarious opening credit scenes in the history of cinema for a while i heard that the studio wanted the film to include more mutants but im glad the filmmakers kept things to just a few characters for this first installment aka origin story so its simple enough for the new fans to follow i love how the humor is so brash and unapologetic its like insult comedy or one of them roast shows everybody is fair game the fights are rock em sock em and the vfx is impressive and i cant be happier for ryan reynolds im sure he had been wanting to redeem himself since green lantern and whatever the hell that was in x men origins wolverine so with this deadpool movie he finally got it right you can tell he desperately wanted to be part of this superhero genre and so now hes really part of the gang he was born for this role he was destined to play this in many ways deadpool is kinda like van wilder on crack and actress morena baccarin as vanessa\u0085 well lets just say that after watching this movie every guy on earth will wonder why cant my girlfriend be more like that if youre looking for a date movie deadpool is it if youre looking for an action packed movie deadpool is definitely most certainly it", "one word describes this movie   pointlesswow this film was incredibly boring people are hyping this movie over nothing the story is so simple and boring it didnt even feel like i was watching a thought provoking movie more like a short and simple tv series with an unfunny forced and pointless main character on his pointless adventure to fight forgettable and pointless villains the x men were pointless as well they didnt add anything to the story they only assisted deadpool with fighting the villains when their original goal was to have deadpool work for them they happily accepted deadpool as a murderer and wished a murderer to join them the only okay point in this movie was the action however the action still could have been better as it felt very rushed at times and at other times very short and at times it lacked in good choreography it didnt feel intense at all more like you know the villains are going to fail very easilyi also hated the use of childish words being used quite a bit to explain the purpose of the weapon x program eg superheroes superslaves etc what are these villains even doing there was nothing deep and meaningful behind the program and these villains the story was lacking in too many ways the world felt very empty and hollowlooks like people are very cheap and easy nowadays that they would enjoy anything just because it is r rated that is the truth that is the only reason this movie has such a high rating because of the use of f words and other vulgar words it has sex and nude scenes and it is gory and violent none of this is new again the story and characters are terrible", "if you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you every other line contains the f word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest aroundthe story is about as hollow as the humor its a cheap and bland story about revenge and invincibility painted with a veneer of love that is as misguided as the characters personalitythe movie is littered with sarcasm and cynicism that just becomes depressing after a whileryan reynolds acts like a 13 year old boy throughout the movie cursing and making penis jokes and then talking to the audience thinking he is very funny this is the most overrated movie ive seen most of these reviews on imdb had to have been paid for hollywood had to have paid for this hype or people these days have really low standards this is a low brow film like no othersave 2 hours of your life and do not watch this movie", "with a brilliant script visceral action and a oscar worthy performance by lead ryan reynolds 2016s deadpool takes superhero and comedy films into a new direction and proves that comic book movies still have a lot more to offerproof of the benefits of filmmakers taking risks rather than following the working formula deadpool takes the superhero genre and heightens it with its unapologetic offensive humor bloody and intense violence as well as a excellent cast and script deadpool is an example to not only based ones characters and stories off of the original material but to embrace the heart and soul of the comic book medium as a whole", "the long awaited deadpool is finally and with its much talked about hard r rating starring ryan reynolds as a quick taking fourth  wall breaking insult throwing masked superhero we hear about how deadpool became deadpool told in flashback sequences while simultaneously following a present day plot as well the question for the average movie goer is is this film really as good and as raunchy as everyone says no it isnt i dont mean to ramble much so ill start with the good this film does have some humorous moments and most of the supporting characters are very entertaining to watch and yes this film also does have some good action sequencessadly that is where the good ends this films tries very hard to be edgy and raunchy as well as claiming to not be your average marvel film because of those following reasons but let me assure you this film is most definitely very similar to all of the other marvel films by saying fuck a few times showing breasts at a strip club and throwing childish insults such as dicktits is not smart filmmaking or screen writing it is easy adolescent humor this film has a simple plot that is easy to follow and is spoonfed to you i have seen good comedies and i have seen good superhero films and this excels in neither in this films defense it may not try to be anything other than feel  good fun turn your brain off type film but that within itself is lazy filmmaking i shouldnt have to turn my brain off to have enjoy a film", "first off i do not read comics so i do not know the source material i am not a fan boy of marvel or dc i just want to see entertaining movies i may be in the minority at least during its first week of being in theaters but i wanted to write a review to warn others what deadpool is likethe movie is honestly a nonstop exercise in profanity with a lot of sex jokes and masturbation jokes especially i am fine with low brow humor when it is funny the writers just seem to have reynolds throw out as many wisecracks as possible and hope that some are funny i think anyone over 30 will be bored with the jokes there is nothing that offends me from hearing all these jokes but rather bores me because the lack of humor it is very much like having to listen to some teen kids try to show off by using non stop profanity only to realize they are just making themselves look dumbthe plot is nothing more than a simple background origins story and it is run of the mill the movie has a lot of violence but nothing creative the movie is very similar to super and the kick ass movies however those movies were superior to deadpool on every level imo the movie also reminds me of the vacation remake the 2015 remake of vacation was pretty much one raunchy joke after another but they are not funnythis movie may just be better for younger audiences but i still feel the 30 and up demographics are not going to find this to be a very good movies unless they are a fan of the source materiali give it a 2 out of 10 it gets an 2 instead of 1 only because morena baccarin was a side character she did the best she could with the limited materialdea", "ryan reynolds is the embodiment of the deadpool character he did an absolutely awesome job and made the movie as epic as it is in my opinion his sense of humour perfectly matches that of the original character before watching the movie i was a bit afraid the story of wade would slowdown the roller coaster ride bit it is nicely scattered throughout the movie not so much to lose track of the original storyline and not too little to be oblivious of where the superhero comes from i think i would have enjoyed it a bit more if more of the marvel universe was pulled into the story but im not completely sure of it  the fourth wall being broken here and there is very refreshing and very deadpool", "based on the marvel comics character of the same name it is the eighth installment in the x men film series it follows wade wilson who after being subjected to an experiment that leaves him with new abilities hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his lifefrom the studio that inexplicably sewed his *beep* mouth shut the first time comes deadpool it may not have been the superhero that hollywood wanted but hes certainly the one they deserve after years of speculation as to whether or not everyones favourite anti superhero would actually get made into a standalone picture tim millers deadpool has arrived do not let the february release date fool you this is very much the film that both fans of the character and ryan reynolds have been waiting for full of comedic snark and constant fourth wall breaks and inception style fourth wall breaks within those it delivers every bit upon its promise a truly entertaining ride from start to finish minutes into opening credits you are gracefully dropped into the self aware world of the film with notable credits such as directed by an overpaid tool and produced by *beep*hats if that does not sell you on what kind of comedy deadpool brings to the table then you can always catch a screening of zoolander 2 next door when it comes down to it deadpool is one part vendetta film one part romantic tale a la beauty and the beast style this is the role that ryan reynolds were born to play its been a passion project for the actor for many years and it shows he is to the deadpool franchise the sequel were already planned ahead of its release what robert downey jr is to iron man you cannot imagine anyone else possibly playing the role erased from memory is the x men origins wolverine version that reynolds played in 2009 what a relief the tie in to the world of x men is somewhat limited aside from the inclusion of colossus and negasonic teenage warhead i will not saying more at the end of the day deadpools re watch factor is sky high possibly the most important success of them all im touching myself tonight", "out of all marvel movies made deadpool was the worst the main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes the jokes were not funny the scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well donethey tried to put in 2 x men character in the worst possible way it really shows that the studio had no budget for many characters but instead they invested a lot in the slow motion special effect which was coolin terms of story line theres no story theres no character building as well for about 2 hours all you can do is endure the horrible blabber mouth of the main character not funny and irritate the eari wonder how many people did the studio pay to write in good reviews in this websiteworst marvel movie ever", "if ive to keep it short   the movie is really really badthere are plenty of jokes plenty even when yo dont want one these jokes are true to deadpool but thats it they are the jokes deadpool would crack but most of the time they missed the mark and were not even remotely funnytheres absolutely no story in the movie none at all on top of that if youve watched all the trailers watching movie is worthless the entire story is   ajax converted wade into deadpool deadpool searched him to fix his face and once its cleared that ajax is not going to do that deadpool killed him yeah entire 10 minutes stretched into a almost 2 hour movie on top of that for some reason ajax kidnaps pools girlfriend and sets target on his back it makes no senseapart from jokes deadpool also has inner voice but not in this movie hes most of the time blabbering to himself because of that making it much more unfunnythere cannot be much said about the movie as its just extended trailer done badly", "this movie is a huge disappointment and a waste of money and time the jokes are stupid and i realize that deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be too bad as i usually love the marvel movies it seems forced and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level more adolescent bathroom style humor the story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes at times i thought to walk out but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive i kept hoping this movie is more about money making hype with its non existent story plot and childish humor with no depth a huge disappointment", "barney the dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie yeah sure when he cracks one or two jokes its funny but my gosh he would go on and on  regarding the sexual scenes of the movie if one wants to watch porn theyd watch porn i dont know which woman enjoys a man that talks from beginning to end  even during sex he is cracking lame jokes cant get any more ridiculous than that  as for the storyline  couldnt they add a little more detail its like they thought making him blabber

get go funny irreverent and self aware marvel appears to have adopted a doctrine of making their films be entertaining imagine that above any other concerns and deadpool seems to be a culmination of that philosophy it is a testament to the skill and commitment of marvel and the makers that they can get so much mileage out of one second tier character and half the budget than other companies can with four first rate ones fantastic or otherwise way to redeem yourself 20th century fox not bad for a character that was a created as a joke for the non initiated deadpool started life as a blatant clone of deathstroke a character from dc comics marvels main competitorin all this the film is aided in great part by a crackling script that never lets up whereas too many action movies treat the scenes between set pieces as filler packed with exposition and the occasional comic relief deadpool deftly weaves between wise  cracking slapstick violent acrobatics and scenes of serious peril with effortless ease the result of all of this is a movie that is engaging throughout whether featuring profane brilliant banter or graphical bloody shootouts for the film wears that r rating proudly with enough sex and violent to make paul verhoeven get all misty eyed it is not surprise there is already a sequel in the worksanother revelation here is reynolds himself who in deadpool seems to have found his iron man a character so indelibly linked to the actor that plays him that you cannot imagine anyone else playing him and his work here acts as vindication of that whole wolverine debacle which we wont mention ever again but the secret ingredient in the deadpool stew is geek heroine morena baccarin who besides being cute as a button brings the acting chops honed in fan favorites like gotham and firefly or even as the darnest adorable reptilian alien ever in the short lived v reboot baccarin has the perfect easy going confidence to match reynolds sardonic bravado and their superb and convincing on screen chemistry provides the impetus for deadpools heroic arcfor despite all the foul language gore and masturbation jokes this is a story that is surprisingly tender it turns out it wasnt just a marketing gimmick and deadpool really is a love story to be sure one with more severed body parts than your average love yarn but a love story nonetheless starting a new franchise is always risky and studios hate taking risks whatever your stance on comic books is the fact remains this movie should not have been this good the writers and director have shown what can be achieved with bold writing and an unapologetic attitude and more importantly that comic book movies need not be made for kids to be enjoyable or indeed successful heres to hoping that trend will continue hopefully hollywood will take noticeparents briefrated r running time 108 minutes on sex and violence plenty of both there is graphic violence of the gratuitous kind people get shot in all kinds of

of neat ideas but doesnt really pay them off the biggest twists were both spoiled by the movie itself it could have done a neat bourne identity type story discovering her past but the trailers already told us who she was and in case you missed the trailers the movie shows us in a mind reading flashback they could have done a nice twist about who are the good guys and who are the bad guys but the movie spoils that by showing us characters who were revealed as villains in guardians of the galaxy it could have done a nice fish out of water story but brie larsons performance is completely one note there is no real change in behavior between vers and caroland on a side note the de aging on fury was good but carrying on that technology for that much screen time makes the uncanny valley affect inevitable and it did take me out of the story a few times and coulson looked downright plastic in the stairwell scenei really wanted to like this but i didntps im not a conspiracy theory guy but i have been trying to post this on rotten tomatoes for weeks for some reason it keeps failing to post while there are hundreds of 5 star ratings from accounts that were just created this month and have only reviewed one movie", "just got home from seeing the movie and immediately told all my fellow mcu fans they need to see it then i hop on here and see negative review after negative review and i disagree with most of them feels like i was in a different movie only thing i will agree with was bad is the fact that we dont know of a captain marvel weakness shes insanely overpowered but i mean so is scarlet witch if you think about it scarlet witch could take down any of the avengers if she wanted to and she sorta did in ultron when she was making all of them see their worst fears by the way why has she not done that since that movie but thats besides the point the only weakness scarlet witch has had was her love for vision but that wasnt introduced until later in her story so i dont think its bad that we dont know captain marvels weakness yet this is the mcu she will have more storyline this was just setting up for more to come i actually think brie larsons acting was great we learn very early in the movie that her characters being trained to control her emotions and impulses thats the only thing she knows as she has no prior memories of course shes a little flat because of that but then i find her character builds and develops as now she has the powers to match her confidence and ambition which gives her even more purpose she starts regaining her memories and you can see her unfold as she feels love her old friend and the daughter she stands up against the kree people who she used to trust and shows them shes better off without them she gives the skrulls a chance and ends up fighting for them and giving up her renewed life on earth for them i find her to be a very different character towards the end than she is in the beginning do people keep forgetting that this movie takes place in the 90s this was an early beginning story for both fury and coulson neither of them have gone through any of the crap they soon will so i think its well done that their characters were quite different they will develop with time if you watch this movie then all the other marvel movies in chronological order itd be more clear they also joke that coulson is the new guy which to me explains his slightly timid attitude i went into this movie trying to not let the politics affect my opinion if you go into the movie already with a bad taste in your mouth you might be disappointed and i in no way support some of the things brie larson has said and done but i dont find that any of that was brought into the movie and i am capable of letting those two instances be separate i dont have to love and support every actor actress in a movie in order to love the movie i am a female in my mid 20s and i felt very empowered by this movie my 29 year old brother felt empowered i feel like this movie is intended to be motivational for all audiences and doesnt try to tear anyone down goose was amazing and adorable up until he eats the bad guys that was weird and uncomfortable to me but ok still love goose is it the best marvel has done no but i am overall very pleased with the movie and will be seeing it again and again i just wish it gave us more teasers towards the rest of the avengers and endgame but i guess i can wait another month for that if i have to", "where do i even start with this messlet me start by saying ive been a comic book fan since i was a child i live and breathe marvel and will defend their stories and characters until the day i die ive been able to find something enjoyable in every marvel movie to date until i saw captain marvelthis movie is a huge mess it has a wildly inconsistent tone extremely boring one note characters awful pacing and worst of all an absolute nothing of a main characterbrie larson is so wooden and plain i couldnt take anything she said seriously and any attempt at charisma from her made me cringe for those defending her performance her character has amnesia shes trying to figure out who she is allow me to point you in the direction of the bourne films matt damon plays a character that doesnt know anything about himself and i was firmly invested in his performance from start to finishthis movie insists on telling you how important captain marvel is without doing anything to earn it or demonstrate that to the audienceaside from a boring performance of a boring main character there is the matter of the script that drags down whatever this movie had going for it captain marvel takes itself so seriously but provides nothing by way of tension or stakes it winds up being a completely dull experience which is the worst thing a colourful superhero movie can bethe only thing going for this movie is samuel l jackson who delivers his usual solid performanceas a fan of movies this film is really poorly executed and as a fan of marvel i was extremely disappointed on both fronts id highly recommend skipping this one", "i liked a little of the film i found it too short for a movie that was spent a fair amount of money ran a little of the comic has no impact being a marvel film there is not much mystery in its powers i think some of the avengers are much stronger than her but the action of the film the design of the film the plans the way they portrayed the 90s was very cool the homage they did to stan lee was very touching i did not like a post credits  but the other scene left an expectation in the air for the next film of the avengersnome maycon lira dos santos turma 2002 n\u00famero1", "just like harry potter and the lord of the rings the marvel cinematic universe was a major part of my childhood ive been a cultish follower of the mcu ever since my dad introduced it to me the experience of watching tony stark tinker his way out of a cave and end up divulging i am iron man to an entire audience of reporters jumpstarted a major aspect of my life as a girl growing up watching these movies i was looking forward to the long awaited female lead and i had such high hopes for this movie the reality of it fell flat and i fear my honest reviews fall on deaf ears as most people hear it as a complaint on the feminist aspects of the movie and a direct reflection of brie larson we deserve a better movie while brie larson has no acting abilities whatsoever i firmly believe her success in room was solely due to the fact that her face and voice are regularly void of all emotion so the role was not much of a stretch she was not the only issue the directing and the storytelling were terrible and i cant believe kevin feige let anna boden and ryan fleck massacre this story and the characters within it what happened to fury the stoic steadfast leader of shield why did they make him out to be so disingenuous and happy go lucky this is nick fury the war hardened soldier we all know and love experiencing his first glimpse of alien life on earth and they turned him into a barely affable fool who failed to bring any realistic comic relief in a movie marinated in attempts at comic relief his scenes with the cat were ridiculous and some of the choices he made seemed far fetched and unrealistic why did he bring a woman he barely knew into a secure top secret facility he had no reason to trust her she had done nothing for him they had no relationship and i thought the main goal of the movie would be to develop that relationship and rapport between him and captain marvel what was their story how did they meet why did he have her pager why did he wait so long to use it while a few of these questions were answered the relationship was forced and the rapport was stale and never developed the guardians of the galaxy developed a quick one movie relationship because they went through hell and back together within a short period of time they were arrested and imprisoned together they escaped together they get blown up on knowhere together attacked by ronin and ravagers together and end up banding together to hold an infinity stone of course they have an amazing relationship after one movie this movie did not provide an opportunity for captain marvel and nick fury to develop the relationship that was so desperately needed instead it played pretend and failed because the audience isnt stupid this movie came across as a slapstick parody of the mcu after rewatching all the movies in preparation for endgame i realized it made a mockery of the success marvel had spent ten years developing it was as if the directors attempted to poorly imitate taika waititis success in thor ragnorak and despite the fact that brie larson spent her entire press tour bashing men she spent the entire movie trying to copy the successful acts of robert downey jr and chris pratt theres a reason tony stark and peter quill are likeable theyre played by likeable actors who can pull of the hilarious one liners and quips brie larson doesnt have the likeability or the acting capability to pull that off she was a poor choice for the movie the entire character of captain marvel was a toss up between a stoic unflappable kree soldier and a jovial knockoff of well loved mcu characters you never knew which one you were going to get would she be joking and laughing in this scene or would she be serious and dispassionate that kind of jostling made the movie into a failed juggling act the tone was all over the place making it hard to follow the plot whos bad whos good and why are they laughing all of a sudden captain marvel the character was presented with no flaws while the movie was riddled with them ronin the accuser the kree leader whod spent years enacting mass genocide threatened to unseat thanos and held an infinity stone in his hand turned away when he saw captain marvel i can suspend my disbelief but not that much and not like that the movie had no true villain no true plot and was used as a vessel to force the audience into liking brie larson and her captain marvel presentation and it failed spectacularly this movie was supposed to pay homage to stan lee not brie larsons painful acting career the reason characters like thor tony stark and captain america are so well loved is because they have flaws they draw empathetic responses from the audience because the audience can relate to their struggles there was nothing relatable about brie larsons captain marvel she made a historic comic book character into a snobbish b*tch with magic hands the audience cheered when they saw thor and captain america in infinity war captain marvel will never illicit such a response if anything shell be booed it was a testament to how poor the acting directing and editing was that i consider this movie to be one of the worst movies i have ever paid money to see its an embarrassment to the marvel universe and i will be severely disappointed if brie larson and her inhuman emotionless vacuum of a character swoops in and saves the day in endgame ive invested too much time and money into this franchise to watch her single handedly destroy it i hope they kill her off", "ive liked brie larson in other films but she showed zero range in this when your main character in a superhero movie is unwatchable you already have a problem in addition captain marvel has no weaknesses which kills the tension immediately there is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing or any danger at all for that matterits an ok origin story but it makes no sense as to why shes supposedly so powerfulthe cat was good", "i couldnt believe how boring this movie was the acting is horrible the action is terrible and captain marvel herself is super cheesy this is the worst marvel movie for me alongside ant man and the was", "do you enjoy watching a movie in which the main character has the same facial expression throughout the entire movie if yes then this movie is made for you otherwise stay away from this horrific movie the excuse is they rushed this for endgame but still couldnt have a worse job there isnt a single enemy or moment in the movie where you feel that the hero is in any danger the origins of her powers still make absolutely no sense and this movie answers no questions and just tells you that this happened and accept it without any background ive honestly never been so bored at a cinema in my entire life id give it 3 stars but the acting drags it down to 1", "1 bad storytellinga lot of people dare i say a majority of those who pay to watch a superhero origin story want to see how their favorite character got to be a superhero not how they kick bottoms after they become one2 bad character developmentpeople dont like it when in the course of introducing a new character some of their beloved established characters are made fun of or act differently3 bad idea in general p people dont like it when the source material is changed to further a political agendaand4 bad promotionpeople dont like it when theyre told by the lead actor in the movie that their opinions dont matter", "there is nothing to look forward to in this movie the story is so bad that dark world would seem watchable", "this was definitely the weakest of all the 22 marvel movies to date at the rock bottom of the list it was arguably the one that deviated the most from the comic book source material and not in the same good way that civil war ragnarok age of ultron iron man 3 and spiderman did had the least character depth and development particularly with captain marvel herself had the weakest direction lighting writing pacing musical score sound effects etc nick fury is diminished to basically being the comic relief for a lead who has only 3 emotional ranges the entire movie frustrated snarky and confused action scenes are poorly choreographed dimly lit and shot in that shaky camera youre part of the fight style thats basically guaranteed to make the viewer not know what the heck is happening so many plot holes that are so huge you could fly a hundred quinjets through them by the end the audience wasnt cheering and clapping remember toward the end of the first avengers movie where hulk tosses lori around like a rag doll but were groaning shaking their heads whispering wtf under their breaths and checking their phones to see how much more of the movie was leftthere are some good moments mainly the scenes where samuel l jackson or ben mendelson or goose the cat are in but these are very few and far betweeneveryone i saw the movie with are praying that avengers endgame isnt ruined by captain marvel being in it and were praying for the future of the mcu if marvel plans to make captain marvel their standard bearer moving into phase 4 thats how bad cm wasdisney marvel   please do not let these writers and directors near another mcu movie live and learn from this one fans are all willing to give this one a pass but if movies like this is what we have to look forward to captain marvel will be the movie everyone looks back on as the beginning of the sad end of the mcu", "sorry captain marvel really painfully average movie that was so obviously shoehorned into the mcu to make the next phase of marvel a sad reality after seeing this i felt as if the wind were taken out from my wings endgame will be amazing im sure but holy crap i would rather watch alita another 50 times than sit through this movie even one more time was not good", "overall an ok movie but doesnt meet the high standards already set by marvel brie larson was ok she started actually being engaging during her training phase alongside jude law she started with charismatic performance with humour but this performance turned very wooden very quicklysamuel l jackson was the best performer by far but this movies plot writing has ruined his character fury was the head honcho of shield and avengers who had presence and weight but here he is portrayed as being inspired by captain marvel even tho she didnt earn that level of adoration whatsoever also how fury lost his eye was pathetic and disrespectful to his character he is shown cowering holding a cat during a gunfight which annoyed me because its just not a true representation of nick fury at allcaptain marvel   carol danvers although showing potential at first shown zero character development or significant arc she remains unjustly cocky throughout and un engaging for most of movie and ridiculously overpowered for no real reason other than she absorbed an explosion and inherited these powers for no logical reasonoverall a decent movie fantastic cgi with de aging effects but definitely not rewatching or buying on blu ray", "im a huge marvel fan and this was such a disappointment i was bored and my mind drifted a lot during it it feels rushed and made with no love i really didnt care for the character at all or root for her even sam l jackson coldnt redeem it a total letdown and definitely the low point of the mcu", "truly shocking ive enjoyed every marvel film and then i dont know what it was just a mess from the start couldnt care scene after scene seemed just joined together and made zero sense i have only ever walked out once in my life from the cinemai tried so hard not to but in the end this was the 2nd time truly it was terrible ", "watched captain marvel the things i liked first 1 talos ben mendelson was really entertaining as the villain 2 samuel l jackson was good 3 the cat except for thatwhat i didnt like 1 everything about brie larsons performance she was wooden delivered her dialogue like she was reading off cards no charm no charisma no emotion whenever she showed emotion it felt massively forced and disingenuous she is just incredibly unlikeable and i cant believe they got the casting this wrong i hope they kill her off and an adult monica rambeau takes her place fun fact monica was captain marvel in the 80s before carol danvers was even ms marvel2 the writing good lord this film was lazily written not only was the dialogue garbage but come on did every single man in her life have to be a horrible misoginist and the super thin feminist message the kree patriarchy were holding her back the inhibitor chip and once they stopped she was unstoppable really3 they ruined several characters mar vell had one of the best arcs ever in the comics but nope shes just shot in the chest what a waste of annette benings talent the skrulls one of the best villains in marvel comics and the entire set up for the awesome story secret invasion nope theyre the good guys because we need an analogy for refugees and we already discussed monica rambeau4 thats how fury lost his eye screw you movie5 boy howdy they messed up the marvel timeline so they were shield in the 90s i thought coulson didnt have that name until 2008 shes the inspiration for the avengers nah man that is cap so fury knew about aliens already why was he so shocked by the chitauri and the asgardians ugh this movie was so lazy it was like theyve never seen a marvel moviein conclusion this movie was terrible it did real damage to the mcu and will continue to if shes the face going forward i thought to myself while watching this you know if you guys hadnt run off joss whedon he could have made this movie amazing no one does strong female characters as well as joss buffy the vampire slayer dollhouse and the women of firefly not to mention how good he wrote black widow in avengers 1 to being a 3 dimensional character and not just eye candy this movie proved that marvel still doesnt know how to make strong female characters as the focus of a movie sure they can be side kicks but cant carry a movie compare that to dc for all their flaws dc makes killer female characters wonder woman amazing suicide squad may have been a train wreck but they nailed harley quinn how she uses overt sexuality to her advantage and she can throw down in a fight plus she is an actual 3d character and they nailed amanda waller being a cold hearted b**ch but you have to respect her mera was probably more capable than aquaman until the endif you want to watch a superhero with a feminist message supergirl on cw she is also the strongest by far in the arrow verse but unlike brie she is charismatic likeable flawed and still badass when she throws downthis movie was trash and i hope thanos kills herend of rant", "it was a waste of time the first half of the movie was average where they tried to make some connections with previous marvel movies and brought some of the old villains however the later half of the movie was a total disaster it was the worst superhero movies that i have ever watched i wasted $23 on two tickets to watch this total piece of junka big no no for someone who wants to watch a good movie", "a forced movie a silly alien cat a weak plot and most people are eating it up sm", "this certainly is a stinker special effects anno 1987 and facial prostethics worse than early star trek what happened the movie is also chock full of extremely immature  you gogirl dumb scenes on top of dumber scenes with every dumb point telegraphed and overstated to make sure you get no surprises or enjoyment lest you miss the message it seems the mouse factory more and more lately is churning and peddling political cheese as in cheesy identity politics so now to top the cheese they actually casted brie with the star wars gender wars movies black panther black power and now this tribalism pitting ethnic groups against each other and pushing gender war", "the only good thing about this movie is the 90s nostalgia other than that its a basic sci fi movie with the marvel brand slapped onto it", "i hate the way the end credits of infinity war made me feel like i just had to see this movie this was definitely a movie i could have done without seeing and a waste of money the story was boring the acting was stiff and corny it was like watching a superhero parody movie almost a comedy i laughed and cringed through the whole movie i am a female writing this review and i did not like this movie at all the part where she said ive been fighting with one hand tied behind my back which was supposed to be a pivotal moment for the movie was the most laughable moment on screen also there was no character development and very many plot holes the way nick fury lost his eye was absolutely ridiculous a cat scratchreally this move is a disgrace to the mcu", "well ive watched this movie for the record cause i had no particular expectations for it brie larson is not gal gadot and it was obviously seen in the trailers however there was a hope that such charismatic actors as jude law and samuel jackson would push it on but alas jude laws character simply didnt reveal and about s jackson i will write furtherthis movies problem is that it is not memorable it doesnt bring emotions theres no drama theres nobody to empathize its impossible to identify yourself with the protagonist for she both being a usual human and having become basically invulnerable shows no serious feelings   absolutely it looks like marvels movie makers merely were afraid to give this stone lump of good and justice any kind of real human feelings   the feelings inherent in a real human human can be weak vulnerable can lose heart can be afraid can be merciful compassionate and so on humans are not ideal and thats why they can be attractive in the movie its creators obviously forgot about a simple truth a viewer must put himself in the place of characters he must be catched by their stories here we have an unalive unreal superhero whose invulnerability and roboticness drastically decreases interest in her while superman had kryptonite while there was a drama as superman loved a mortal woman vulnerable for enemies there were mortal parents in the case of the captain theres no such thing she doesnt love anyone she is not tied to anyone she is unreal non archetypical fictional she has no roots in real lifethis movie is not a comedy too yes there were one or two funny moments with fury with mainskrull when i grinned and thats all nick fury who was a severe and contradictory character has been turned into someone quite unserious with not very good sense of humour slobbering over a cat like a baby its awfulbased on skrulls metamorphness there could be a great detective line in the spirit of for example john carpenters the thing when everybody is under suspicion and its not clear who is who but alas such a possibility to waken viewers interest was simply ruined with another questionable twistthe soundtrack is not memorable inserting of the 90 s songs is out of place it looks like they took some songs without thinking whether it would work or not basically theres no 90 s atmosphere yes some antediluvian computers were shown yes i grinned slightly but there was no feeling of nostalgia for the real 90 svisually sometimes its good at times it looks quite bad by the standards of marvel generally speaking its made with no own directors vision and style for example although zack snyders films shot for dc have obvious problems he manages to make the scenes spectacular pleasing to the eye even if theres no actionbasically this movie doesnt add anything special to mcu its very very boring origin story yes we were shown how nick fury lost his eye   and wed better not have seen that yes we were revealed that pagers story nothing special tooif she simply comes and defeats the purple titan the people whove been watching this truly great show by marvel for more than 10 years   what will they say i hope that marvels bosses will find a way to reduce the captains powers otherwise the avengers endgame may become a turning point for this cinematic universe people are getting tired of comics based films and if its gonna become a conveyer ala star wars episode 7 8 9 1017 steadily supplying mediocre uninteresting films such as captain marvel ruining the well established canon   films made for the sake of the current moment it may be the beginning of the end for

the weakest and most boring mcu movies since the black panther and what bothers me is movies such as this and black panther are only praised not because of actual talent from production actors but because they uphold social justice not only was this an sjw ridden crapfest its also very boring the lead female actress is terrible monotone and immature jude law would have been far superior as the main character waste of time and money", "while the movie was enjoyable to watch at times i felt like i was watching it just so i wouldnt become lost in future marvel films captain marvel was underwhelming regrettably i truly wanted this to be a knock out unfortunately the ko was my attention i found myself moving a lot and becoming bored  waiting for the marvel to really take flight most of the jokes and 90s pop culture references felt lackluster and forced remember that song guys here it is i felt bries performance was yawn able at best maybe mis casting or mis direction is to blame but something was off the tone felt like a juggling act this doesnt feel like a film that is to bring the fourth phase of the mcu and more like thor 2 dark world all in all blah blah blah i only read

difficulty in emoting to a tennis ball on a stick but all their tics and quirks seem to be masking a void at the centre of what should be a free floating evocative trip sure its weird looking but weve seen it before and back then in films like edward scissorhands it had a sense of purpose now were left exploring a cgi wonderland that seems to be without a great deal of wonder the book revels in its bizarre environs absurd dialogue and whimsical characters this film grounds them drains them of that mystery and leaves us with a colourful but forgettable retread it seems intent on driving us to a narrative conclusion that few people will have had much stake in through its running time simply because were not giving much to care forwith a source material so familiar even to those whose knowledge is second hand references there needs to be a degree of innovation as in svenkmejers dark stop motion version or the co opting of terry gilliam in to his tideland narrative or else a

history of alice in wonderland you cant help but hope for something special and thats the problem that tim burton while he is still making decent films has been a long way off special for some time now6 10 if they gave half stars itd be 65 but that doesnt mean its a bad film its possible that my grade is affected by high expectations and lost potential if you have kids im sure itll be better than 90% of the dross that passes for family films now at least there is some artistry involved and while he might not be at his best ill still always pay to see a tim burton film although i got this one for free", "it is still worth the high price of the 3 d admission to see some of the amazing animation and design but the writing is extremely boring and clumsy and the performances cannot save it too many liberties were taken with the originals here and in no way improve upon them it only barely resembles either of carrolls books in theme and some specific scenes there are some disney moments that literally set off a gag reflex as wellthe animation is quite stunning and wonderful though as is the costuming and set design in so much as there were sets and not just green screens im sure some actual props were used there are some clever elements that owe only to good visual design and direction im sure as the only other clever bits in the dialogue were the parts directly lifted from the originals", "i am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it unlike avatar which used the 3d technology as an integral part of the movie 3d adds nothing to this movie and frankly the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image thanks to projectors that arent as bright as they used to be was pretty bland let me state for the record for anyone who doesnt know the movie conflates the two books and adds in jabberwocky for the hell of it and back story 19 year old alice is about to marry the wrong man she was too old for lewis carroll the queen of hearts becomes the red queen and the knaves of hearts become a cross between the clone robots for star warsclone wars and sow bugs 1 a bland blond victorian dorothy gale lives in kansas er england and is about to marry a prig she has recurring nightmares about oz er wonderland er underland and falls down the rabbit hole unlike the wizard of oz there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence filmed in color which ruins the supposed effect to wonderland nor does alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in wonderland the actress registers no emotion about anything 2 johnny depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films his movies now resemble the parodies that carol burnett used to do on her show sweeney todd being the exception he has now ruined to wonderful movies with a lot of help from tim burton charlie and the chocolate factory was excruciating in its twee ness and as with alice added too much back story and robbed the original roald dahls original book of both its charm and character while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was this movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still cant compare to disneys own animated version 3 tim burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors ed wood edward scissorhands what happened to that johnny depp more sweeney less fantasy please4 why do anne hathaways arms not straighten whats up with thateverything that makes lewis carroll lewis carroll has been leached out of this movie", "sometimes i think that i should like tim burton movies more than i do dont get me wrong the man has made some excellent films such as the masterful ed wood but all too often despite an agreeable tendency towards visual flamboyance i leave his films feeling somewhat underwhelmed alice in wonderland is a case in point its a movie where cgi effects rule the day but the trouble is that the true weirdness that is at the heart of this story is not captured at all with all the computer generated imagery on screen sure its very efficient and well designed but like cgi in general its far too polished to really strike a chord and convince there is a distinct lack of wonder in this wonderland the otherworldly weirdness is dissipated too by the use of overly familiar voices to give life to the various denizens of this world we are left thinking oh thats stephen fry hey isnt that alan rickman im sure thats christopher lee and isnt that the bloke from little britain etc it consistently takes us out of the movie and grounds the characters in a way that is just counter productive we want weirdness from an alice in wonderland film not slick cgi and famous voice over actorsthere is also a dangerously cosy predictability at play here too tim burton johnny depp danny elfman \u2013 they say familiarity breeds contempt well thats a bit strong but it is seriously lacking in surprises and you cannot help think that all three individually talented men could do with taking a break from each other for the good of their careers depps mad hatter is pretty uninspired by his standards while burtons visuals and elfmans music are nice but ultimately completely forgettable i found it very difficult to care for any of the characters in this film and that is never a good thing it also meant that the conclusion came across as deeply trite as we have been given nothing to empathize with we dont know or have any interest in these characters so when alice goes around her extended family one by one imparting her new knowledge onto them it means nothing it also doesnt help that the journey to wonderland has made absolutely no difference at all to the title characters state of mind \u2013 at the beginning she does not want to get married to the upper class chump and at the end she does not want to get married to the upper class chump so you are left wondering what exactly was the pointi saw this in 3d and if there is one thing that this film has taught me its that i am done with this new and improved technology i sensed it was a gimmick even before i watched avatar now i am certain a bad film is a bad film and no amount of extra visual depth is going to change that one iota its all surface veneer and really thats this movies ultimate problem there is nothing of interest within the cgi 3d a great shame as the source material is undeniably compellingi realize that i am almost done here but i have not even mentioned the worst thing about the film what was it it was when the mad hatter and then subsequently alice do a truly cringe worthy little dance near the end of the film i couldnt believe what i was seeing i half expected britains got talent winners diversity to pop up in a cameo appearance at this stage and join in with some urban street dancing manoeuvres that didnt happen and that is at least one saving grace", "here is a tale of two lewises one wrote a small but great childrens book that still delights surprises and enchants the other wrote a large artistic series of childrens books that push christian sermons at us in the guise of adventure fantasy the first author lewis carroll

original screenplay for the new alice in wonderlandwhat if we turn wonderland into narnia what if an older alice revisits her dream world now called underland and discovers a giant battle in progress

that they managed to make a remake that is worse than the original in every aspect this film looks like a b movie the animation styling and scenery are flawlessly default and most of the movie visuals looks like the designers downloaded a pack of 3d stock models and colored them a bit if you watch a showreel of almost any decent animation studio you will see much better and creative stuff than thisthe direction is ridiculously non interesting some short shots are just plain stupid and i have no idea how is this possible in this budget there is no rhythm there are just a bunch of scenes with a little bit of this and a little bit of that sound editing is retarded with voices overlapping each other atmospheric sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes non existent at the scene where the mad hatter gives a speech and makes a riot in queens castle the cheering crowd sound behind his speech is awful you can download better crowd samples for freemusic sounds like a bunch of sampled ooouuuooo shitty spooky loops of crappy classical music in a default burton way acting is whatever and seems like everything was written and shot in 5 days the voice dubbing of 3d models is worse than the earliest works of dreamworksthere is no drama there is no crescendo there is no playfulness that makes alice in wonderland such a powerful story there is not a shred of imagination here i mean even the opening credits look like they were done in 1 hour to top it all the song in the ending credits cannot be more cheap and that pathetic attempt of the final dance   some miserable version of a popping breakdance is disgusting and is on the level of the mighty morphin power rangerseven on a woman becoming a powerful individual symbolism level the movie as bland as possibleholy **** this movie is a humongous piece of an even more gigantic moronic generic feces that hollywood is happily sitting in join the feast", "adding a little bit of a background story and a few more characters to alices adventures didnt do as much as i thought it would for the story truthfully i wanted to love this movie im a huge tim burton  johnny depp fan but this just didnt do it for me i came out of the theater wondering if it were just the mediocre script or the director who had failed to meet my expectations the best part of this movie is probably johnny depps portrayal of the mad hatter who truly is mad however mia wasikowska presents alice in a dull manner that had me checking my watch every ten or fifteen minutes overall this film isnt awful but at the same time its no masterpiece for an interesting film to look at i suppose this would be an alright choice however if you want a great story and compelling acting you might want to check out something else because this isnt the movie youre looking for", "you dolts took a meandering plot less masterpiece and turned it in all seriousness into a soul less cgi dirge with the same plot that its source was laughing atthe jabberwock is not a dragon the jabberwock is the idea of a dragon it wears spats and a waistcoat you doltsthe queen of hearts never actually chops anyones head off the gryphon says so there is nothing oppressive or dangerous in wonderland wonderland doesnt make enough sense for anything to be dangerouswhere was the gryphon where was the mock turtle where was bill the newt where was the trial of the knave of

unhelpful people the stupid people the bad tempered people yes and even the hero waving his little magic sword at the scary dragon in a waistcoat and spats what does alice say to them who cares for you youre nothing but a pack of cards your story telling has regressed to the shuffling of tropes that children were laughing at over a century agodid you even read the book", "i loved alices adventures in wonderland and remember it as an amazing and timeless adventure indeed alice wanders around in a world so enigmatic and unstable that you never know what will happen next and what twist will put alice in just new trouble often unintentionally and tragically made worse by her own doing now this is all exactly what this movie does not have after alice arrives in the new underland you will soon be in on the entire story it is two sides good against evil and alice is to slay a monster not a single second is unexpected nor are there any twists but even the first minutes are astonishingly wanting any concept scenes without any real characters rush by there is no focus of attention in the opening but most of all my understanding of then brand alice is that she originally wanders around a dream land that confronts her with her own self her anxieties her shadowy anticipation that things will not be all nice and easy all taking shape in landscapes characters and events painted in dream language of this essence it should be no problem to create a movie that really leaves an impression   let alone if tim burton is in the team but there is nothing nothing of this concept in this movie instead of joining a charismatic and mature character on the journey through her own dismal natural instabilities that every one carries inside the story here is already written and alice is only to follow marked footprints for the only reason that she is the one foretold to do it there is merely the most silly hollywood intellectualism where good against evil must be taken as like certainly some sort of metaphor representing all our everyday struggles and it is so much about decision making and all im devastated eventually tim burton has added his potential for design to a movie completely without content the only metaphor i see is lewis carroll appearing at the end in the figure of the jabberwokie and alice slaying him carroll is dead long live alice does hollywood", "alice kingsley mia wasikowska is unbeknownst to her on her way to her engagement party turns out this is the famous alice who 13 years earlier ventured in to wonderland surely there is a creative reason to pull her back into the zany world nope she merely felt the urge to chase a rabbit who himself was seeking to fulfill a prophecy and so alice in roped back into the world of fantasy absurdityif youve seen anything at all on this movie then the strengths are obvious its disney its cgi loaded its in 3d everything visual is well appointed with lavish detail it makes me wonder if director tim burton is better suited as a set designer since he is always given projects for his vision i recall a time where his vision wasnt hampered by the concepts of others at time when his films were so wholly original that nothing else compared and sadly hes been stuck in a limbo of revisions for a decadefor a girl who cant remember anything alice is never surprised she sees giant creatures she shrinks flies on a hat all without a yelp the first person to blame would be burton since wasikowska lacks leading experience still i wonder whats going through her head when she decided to play alice as oppressively jaded outside the last ten minutes shes the antithesis of dorothy having a protagonist whos so down trodden in a beautiful world is counterintuitivejohnny depp you pay the man and hell do his thing i cant tell you that his character the mad hatter is an original im sure its a combination of other depp figurines with the hatter he has carte blanche to do anything anything at all and somehow be considered in character it doesnt matter that hes periodically possessed by a scotsman\u2014hes in character and hes johnny depp so it must be fantastic right more amusing are helena bonham carter and crispin glover the latter of whom you wouldnt recognizethe white queen anne hathaway was in position to be the most complex element of the film i suppose her role is to assume power in the event that her sister is dethroned for a character who talks a big game of peace she sure does mix together an abhorrent potion to return alice to normal size despite repeatedly saying she represents good i didnt see any evidence toes would have been crushed im sure but the vibe from annes portrayal suggested that she wanted to be the calculating nemesisi cant tell you how stupid this movie made me feel for some reason it figured a major plot point would be found in determining the identity of alice if you are seated in the theatre watching a film called alice in wonderland you will not be surprised to find that the lead character of alice is indeed the very same mentioned in the title why we spend most of the film getting to this conclusion feels like an attempt to recreate hook by the end you realize that alice is the problem with wonderland in the 13 years shes been gone her friends seem to be in good health despite the red queen reigning over the land why are they looking for her now the red queen was in power this whole time and they seem to be in good shape but when alice gets there the queen challenges them i suppose shes just as upset to have such a lifeless young girl in her land i for one am disenchanted", "i was able to catch a prescreening of alice in wonderland tonight on march 2nd despite some pretty nifty visuals and jaw dropping set pieces i found the movie to be incredibly dull flat and utterly full of itself the film is merely a vehicle for johnny depp to showcase his talents and he portrays the mad hatter as an actor who cant quite find the right shoes to fill in the role he rotates from a scottish brogue to a feminine lisp and staggers once in awhile as the unmistakable character of captain jack sparrow where the visuals triumph the story lacks the proposed sequel to alice in wonderland is literally a rehash of most of the finer points of the original except a lot more johnny depp  a character who the audience is supposed to sympathize with and root for but who i found a bit annoying and tiresome after awhile the plot is fairly simple alice the stone faced newcomer mia wasisoska whose acting is limited to mildly concerned mildly puzzled and mildly agitated flees from an arranged marriage proposal from a wealthy lord she follows a curious white rabbit and tumbles down a hole into underland referred to as wonderland by alice she then meets a variety of odd characters most of them familiar from the original alice the plot is fairly simplistic and a tad boneheaded the red queen bonham carter slightly overdoing it but arguably the best actor of the bunch rules the land but is pitted against the tiresome goodness and light of her sister the white queen hathaway doing an air headed imitation of you guessed it captain jack sparrow alice is destined by some ancient scroll to defeat the jabberwocky and end the red queens reign of terror alice boils down to mere eye candy something that is visually pleasing but is only a piece of fluff if your a fan of burtons charlie and the chocolate factory this movie is right up your ally i prefer burton at his best with movies that attempt to involve the audience like edward scissorhands ed wood and big fish however this bloated mess is sure to rank in hundreds of millions of dollars but it tugs at our wallets rather than our hearts its a scary thought but i hope that burtons best work isnt behind him 4 1", "before getting into any details as to why i left the cinema with confusion and disappointment i want to start with what i perceive as the best argument why this movie sucks i saw it at an sunday afternoon screening so the cinema was filled with kids at all ages accompanied by their parents and during the whole length of the film i didnt hear a single child laugh or giggle i didnt laugh myself either for that matter but how bad must a childrens movie really be if it completely misses its target audience i mean its not like kids have that high standardsand i would have never believed that i would hold this against a film but why did they feel the urge to suffocate this wonderful piece of fiction under this concrete like story whose pseudo christian undertones were lifted straight from the chronicles of narnia why must sweet little alice become a soldier and killer for the suppressed inhabitants of wonderland why must every character get a real name every piece of magic like the eat me cookies be explained with alchemy every place get a name and a location that is reachable by just walking there any coherent narrative demands logic   but this logic contradicts everything that wonderland used to be abouti have read the source material numerous times both translated and in its original form and again and again i was fascinated by its surreal magic its emphasis on twisted anti logic lewis carroll aka charles dodgson used to be professor for mathematic and a dean in the local church so he used the books as both an outlet for his more crazy thoughts and to praise the innocence of a childs mind and its beautifully incorporated themes   like the idea that the seconds books story unfolds like a game of chessbut this is wonderland revolutions and alice now a young woman must go to war learn that underland  is indeed a real place and the only way to get home is not to just wake up but to kill a towering demon as it was prophecied i guesstim burton didnt seem to have any idea what he wanted to add to the alice myth that hadnt been done before so he constantly shifts back and forth between a nice childrens movie in the tradition of the original disney movie and a dark psychological thriller \u00e0 la american mcgees alice without ever reaching the quality or comitment of either of themthe only redeeming factor in this cgi crap is of course the acting helena bonham carter plays the red queen or better the queen of hearts the screenwriters screwed that one up too and she seems to have the time of her life she was the only character in the whole flick that made me smile once or twice both crispin clover and mia wasikowska play their parts decent and nuanced enough considering whats going on around them especially newcomer wasikowska plays the confusion and hidden inner strength of her character quiet niece and subtle and im looking forward to seeing her in a really good movie anne hathaways white queen was also noteworthy for her fragility and confined madnessbut yeah this is after all a johnny depp flick and i guess he had it coming to damage his exceptional career by blindly trusting into disneys paychecks and burtons whatever it is these two guys have in common its unbelievable here we have the same guy who played ingeniously hunter s thompson and jack sparrow and willy wonka he plays the quintessential mad figure of western culture yet he is easily out acted by a cgi cat a few years back the computer animated tears in the lord of the rings urged me to make some cynical remarks about the future of acting   but here we have an actors whole performance depending on the photo shopping done to his eyes and well a wardrobe and make up which even ziggy stardust wouldnt have worn in his weirdest timesso to sum it up its a shame watching this material and those actors going to waste for the sake of a narrative that no one would have missed it fails as dark fantasy film and whats worse it fails as a childrens storythe most depressing thought i had after leaving the cinema was how many parents must have felt relieved that they never read this crap to their children now i know how it must have felt to be a transformers fan", "disney presents tim burtons alice in wonderlandstarringjohnny depp as willy wonka if willy wonka hadnt been michael jacksonmia

he does bestchristopher lee who actually steals the movie with just two linesandbabs mitchell windsor playing a character her actual real sizei can see why the theyve not really wanted to call the film a proper sequel it is that being the story of a nineteen year old alice who returns to barely remembered wonderland but it also lifts dialogue and scenes from the original books the story is your standard journey emotionally but all set in a very tim burton wonderlandwhich of course looks astounding wonderland is an amazing place often colourful but equally often ravaged and desolate its a treat for the eyes with the imagination and design shining through the technology its very very good but strange things happen if you look somewhere the 3d doesnt want you to look and theres the odd moment of strangely stiff animation especially when human like characters are completely cgi ed upunexpectedly it sometimes feels like one of the narnia films though makes those movies look like accountant led spreadsheets that have been printed out on toilet paper and left out in the rain but mainly its exactly what youd expect from tim burtons alice in wonderland its a great big treat of a movie to be sure given that its tim burton working with disney its often gruesome and scary but not too much it makes you laugh at times it pins you to the back of your seat at others it gets you leaning forward trying to drink in every detail of the place but its not ever actually surprising you know whats up you know where things are going and youre never shocked maybe once in a quiet horrible scene that stands out even amongst the rest even if youve not seen a single still photo or second of footage if you know wonderland and you know tim burton you can picture it yourself effortlesslyso much of it is still in my head this morning but its all visual theres no heartache or sense of triumph that lingers after a great story funny as it is theres only one line im ever likely to quote a single word i just have these amazing images left in my brain in that sense then its appropriately dream likei doubt ill go back and watch it again at the cinema but im most definitely getting the blu  ray when it comes out next week or whenever disney decided they should bring it outif it feels like ive damned it with faint praise i dont intend to its all pretty wonderful for the two hours it takes to speed past you but i just want to make it clear   nothing that goes into your ears or your heart ever quite matches what goes into your eyes", "imagine having no hope for something and it still managing to let you down it began with a pleasant waltz through a fairytale as depicted in disneys rendition of the brilliant satire laden wonderment alices adventures in wonderland by lewis carrol it has turned into another epic movie simply seeking to reach into your pockets and with what nostalgia is left since your own childhood throw the last of your hard earned money at an utter failure in script and creativity at something that looked as though it couldnt possibly fail this hard with names such as tim burton and johnny depp let us understand a few things here there appears to be no logic process by which the stretching and un stretching of her attire takes place it seems that it is simply an idiotic method of plugging fashion the cg characters are the most unmemorable since 9 and have about 0 zero effect on the story other than of course the cat who decides to ruin the only decent possibility of plot in the entire movie alice causes the majority of conflict the scratch on her arm by denying medical attention from the cheshire cat for no apparent reason other than her idiocy the cheshire cat ends up being the essential downfall in my opinion of the plot wherein i did indeed sigh loudly and wish that i were anywhere other than in the theater the cat was used by burton as a deus ex machina in order to save essentially a plot element that discredits any writer by introducing an exceptionally easy solution to a seemingly impossible problem with no given expectation that the aforementioned element had such abilities the character of the mad hatter which is so inconceivably pointless for some reason this attractive girl seems to show some sort of affection towards the mad hatter and he in turn does the same which offers up an awkward feeling as this elderly i guess that was what they were inferring by the bags under his eyes mad hatter with his crooked altogether oddly shaped eyes hits on our heroine the perpetually dumbfounded alice one more easily predictable movie no depth whatsoever seriously no thought necessary once you enter into the theater the humor is sub par half the audience chuckled about 3 times during the film i do believe there was more laughing during the preview of the karate kid than during the actual movie expect to hear alice claim that shes in a dream for the majority of the movie then change her mind until she becomes so confused that smoke literally pours out of her earsto sum up what you should know before the movie this movie is utterly useless the script is nonsense in a way that defies nonsense bland characters with an all too common johnny depp running around as though hes just woken up from a hangover and mainlined dope into his eyeball this is hollywood pumping movies out that it knows will make a couple of bucks for the love of whatever invisible man you believe in do not see ithere are a couple of questions to ask yourself after the movie has ended because maybe just maybe you didnt believe how horrendous it could be1 why does the mad hatter slip in and out of a scottish accent 2 who honestly expected her to become a sailor at the end of this movie i mean what the **** real great surprise huh 3 if they could change their sizes using this potion why do the inhabitants not simply make themselves or alice really big and have her just stomp out the jabberretard 4 why just why does the white queen have to at all times have her hands up in some stupid position 5 dont you wish you had read a review before goingfar more preferential to myself and several of my peers was the plot of american mcgees alice which was a severely macabre twist on the wonderland we once knew also the writers of alice knew that in order to keep someone interested there has to be a storyline that involved a climax or maybe hold on to your hats folks a surprisehttp  wwwimdbcom title tt0466663", "ohthe irony of it as probably many know tim burton started as an employee of disney but his work was considered too frightening and surreal and soon he was fired now this movie marked his return this alone should tell the story face it we never liked tim burton for his amazing skill to write dialogues for the deep characters he create because not counting edward scissorhand there were none we liked him because he was a big kid with a fascinating dark twisted imagination he had style and creativity now the kid is all grown up and became a money hungry prostitute sad and harsh but true sweeney todd was the first sign and thisthis piece of by the way i really had enough of disney too they evolved completely into a regrettable monstrosity poor lewis carroll and poor other artists you ripped off to make ridicoulus amount of money lately you really have no shame left when it comes to nowadays disney i always imagine a scene from an average high school movie you know where the strong and dumb jock terrorises the nerd and when the nerd asks why he says because i can you cant stop me yes congratulation disney a dead artist really cant stop you from completely destroying ruining nullifying his work you really have no shame left sadly the answer is pretty clear the only decent scene was the one with the execution the other were only eye candy without any hint of meaning or depth oh and congratulation for one more thing you even managed to completely ruin even the ending credits with that ear raping dumb teenage pop rock whatever piece of trash song too its not everyday when a bitter and sour cake is topped so nicely with such a disgusting topping you really done something extraordenary but at least it was fitting tim burton will never read this sadly but for what it worth i admired his work now i officially turn my back on everything he creates and let the little goths drool about it they are still young they might grow out of it someday too", "what a over rated self indulgent movie right from the inclusion of johnny deep in a maddening avatar to helena carter as the tyrant witch witch an oblong head tim burton yet makes another movie that is barely watchable and completely loony in a bad waymia wasikowska stars or rather pales as alice devoid of emotion or interest her pale frail look gets on ones nerves as she sleepwalks throughout the film with an expressionless countenance that feels weakens the movie significantly the scenes where she is supposed to be brave look rehearsed and forced in fact i and my friends got so bugged that we wanted her clothes to fall off so that she could create some stir in the audienceanne hathaway vibrant and exquisite in rachel getting married gives a superficial portrayal of the kind and loving white queen poor soul is soulless in the movie as she tries hard to be meryl streep or julie andrews but falters why did tim have to cast her for a role more suitable for an older actress though miscast she at least tries to make a character of her own unlike mia but looks robotic in fact she looked like a typical deceiving hag who would bear her fangs anytime oh shes wearing white symbolizes peace she must be the good one but unfortunately she ends up getting wasted and even though her performance is being berated by a number of viewers i feel that she at least tries to get into her role wish she didnt look so hideous heremad hatter is played by the outlandish johnny depp but he too doesnt cast much impact in his half baked role none of the characters including him connects with the audience none are very likable i remember in chronicles of narnia where though the main four britishers arent versatile actors but the supporting cast shines tilda swinton was towering tormenting and impactful aslan though not a real character still was very likable here everyone is mundane and lifeless depp still tries to give his fullest but the dreary pace of the film outweighs him since his performance isnt groundbreaking or any of that sort and im not a hater of johnny or tim burton loved charlie and the chocolate factory liked timms batman johnnys whats eating gilbert grapehelena plays the red queen in a quirky fashion that gets customary and monotonous she plays the role differently though not the traditional ones who are mostly staunch and resolute instead she plays a role similar to meryl streeps in she devil who gives herself too much airs she is funny and redeeming for a while then she grates because she does the same act throughout the movie and makes her performance one dimensionalcrispin grover is tolerable tweedledum and tweedledee are neither funny nor likable overbearing at times the story is tedious and the animation prosaic the real world characters are so full of themselves and dont supply anything to the movie the final scene is a bit implausible and rushed well it was a long long unending journey in the theater for me certainly a huge disaster from a talented guy 1 out of 10 stars and a thumbs down", "and yet again tim burtons ego gets in the way as it did with willy wonka seriously thinking that he can improve an age old classic by replacing what he refers to as a mere series of events a little girl stumbles through with a trite paint by numbers good versus evil story a la lord of the rings trilogy chronicles of narnia golden compass he leaves out the magic of the books the cutting wit the topsy turvy absurdity which make the stories so special and a little girl called alice whos precocious cleverness is way beyond her years it is not about stifling a directors artistic vision which every artist has a right to or reworking of the story but the mere greed and egotistical ambitiousness with which he went after this project clearly to fatten his pockets poor lewis carrol is rolling in his grave", "i was oh so very excited to see alice in wonderland it was my one of my favorite movies growing up i even went to the theater in my aiw paraphernalia i like tim burton and i like disney do i honestly thought that nothing could go wrong it did1 i couldnt find the plot 2 most of the acting especially alices was absolutely horrible however the red queen and whoever voiced the cheshire cat both did decent jobs 3 the entire thing was animated dont get me wrong i love animation but you should at least match the characters to their environment like avatar did instead of making it look like a sloppy cut and paste job 4 i guessed how the movie was going to play out before alice even got to wonder   oh i mean underland 5 i kept waiting for something exciting to happen and nothing did there wasnt an obvious moral or message or at least not a very good one and there was no reason for her to return to her own world and the thought of her discussing business at the end no just noi cant think of a clearer way to say this dont waste your money", "tim burtons alice in wonderland is a sequel and not a retelling of the original childrens novels by lewis carroll in this film alice is now 19 years old and soon after the death of her father is proposed to be married away feeling pressured she runs off following a white rabbit which leads her to wonderland a place she only vaguely remembers from childhood there she meets past familiar faces as the mad hatter johnny depp the blue caterpillar alan rickman the cheshire cat stephen fry and eventually the red queen helena bonham carter who has been terrorizing the land with her harsh rule and beheading of heads alice finds out that her destiny is to end the red queens rule by slaying the queens dragon jabberwocky as written in the prophesy along the way she meets up with all sorts of colorful charactersif you remember steven spielbergs hook was the live action sequel to peter pan similarly tim burtons film is very much like a close cousin except its about alice the progression of the story is also kind of similar where the main character alice like peter must rediscover herself and finally defeat her nemesis likewise both films are both elaborately staged they are both about growing up and making choices and theres a big showdown chances are if one liked hook one will find many things to like about alicetim burtons version of the wonderlands environments are gorgeous imaginatively created lots of colorful details and breathes life the castles are sleek and intricately designed the creatures are generally live versions cg of the disneys previous animated version and theyre even more odder and fun to look at i particularly loved the portrayal of the chesire cat in this film and the way he snakes through midair like water feels very natural although it wouldnt feel so natural in real life only complaint i may have in terms of visuals would probably be where we see cg versions of natural creatures like dogs  theyre not particularly stylized so their cg ness can be more noticeabledanny elfmans score fits the environment just right giving added intensity when needed this film is essentially tim burtons playground and even if there wasnt any story it still would be plenty of fun to just watch the loony characters in their environment i will add that 3 d aspect of it helped a lotjohnny depp plays the mad hatter with usual gusto as he brings much energy and quirkiness to such an oddball character i suppose there is a mix of willy wonka and jack sparrow in there somewhere given that other characters are mostly or completely cg johnny depps character can feel a bit of out of place as he still feels human helena bonham carter as the big headed literally red queen is fun expressive and extremely likable for such a short tempered character mia wasikowska is particularly noteworthy as alice which she plays with free spirited pluckiness charm and beautythe story admittedly is a simple one although it is to the storys credit that alice is now an adult  it helps since many happenings in wonderland can be quite unfriendly bizarre and grotesque thankfully no more worries about some dream causing some lifelong trauma to some poor child i also appreciated the fact that her wonderland like dreams is an extension of her frustrations with the real world where she felt she had many expectations from outside forces at the same time its not like where the wild things are where other characters are actually projections of real life people from the main characters life for example to read mad hatter as an extension of her father feels a bit like a stretch although the red queen could possibly represent her future mother in law since they both dislike animals certainly one can merely enjoy it at face value and the creativity of this world and be fine with itoverall i enjoyed this world of alice in one sense that may be the important thing if one were to stick to the flavor of the original novel the story within the wonderland i felt wasnt as poignant as real life moments which were filmed with much love and detail given the fact that original story consisted of series of random events and character interactions it was nice to see the characters work together a bit the overall result isnt something beyond what one would expect from this style of work but its fun and where it succeeds it succeeds well thanks to the consistency of tim burtons imaginative visuals *** out of **** starsfor more of my reviews you can follow me on twitter at http

grimacing helena bonham carter was great as always mad hatter was something his lines were witty and his dance was the funniest thing ever every character is special i liked this alice shes strong smart and modern and every time i saw the cat i wanted to be there to hug it i was worried that disney would spoil this movie but i was wrong this is absolutely burtons movie the landscapes will make you forget about everything you saw before atwoods costumes are beautiful they fit the characters same is the make up if you like fairy tales dont miss alice in wonderland", "tim burton film version

flop the 3 d was just a last minute money gimmick there was nothing jumping out or anything exciting as one would expect with 3 d on to the movie it was your typical burton film the over usage of johnny depp and helena carter though alan rickman is in it i enjoy his acting not so much jd or hcs also the way burton changes the story somewhat bothered me the alice defeating the jabborwocky misspelled i know just ruined the main idea of being in wonderland which wasnt even called wonderland throughout the film the use of pigs was another thing that caught me by surprise burton mustve had some of the caterpillars smoke when he put that part in the film tim burton has disappointment many fans including myself and i hope that he doesnt create another monstrosity like this hopefully not wizard of ozi give it 2 stars for the poor remastering of a storybook classic", "when i first heard that tim burton was making alice in wonderland and when later yet i saw the stills and first promotional shots i could not wait to see it i decided to forget all about how disappointing burtons latest movies were and thought to myself well probably all fall in love with him againso when the first reviews turned out to be less than favourable i was surprised when some of then were outright terrible i started suspecting that maybe my expectations had been too high but nothing nothing prepared me for yesterdays bitter disappointmentfirst the positive nice costumes and i mean really seriously nice costumes dresses to die for and hats to wear in a dream and the cheshire cat who is so fluffy that you are seriously tempted to reach out and ruffle his tummy and the red queen who is the only believable character with acting worth the mention and oh wait the list ends hereif burton had spent as much time writing the story developing the characters and working on the dialogue as he had on making sure that the dresses were spectacular this movie might have been quite alright but instead he opted to provide a story so predictable and unimaginative you have to wonder why it was put to screen at all and he seemed to have thought that if the story or lack of it to be honest was not dreadfully bad enough this could be fixed by carefully adding a clich\u00e9 to almost every line in the dialogue and by making sure that there was not a single funny like laugh out loud funny not a half smile ok funny moment in the whole movieworst of all he mercilessly murdered the essence and soul of the characters alice is lifeless boring and mechanical the hatter has a few brilliant moments and he was graciously allowed a few acceptable lines by burton but mostly it is all been there done that another over the top facial paint role for depp the movie leaves one thankful for the red queen \u2013 her character would not impress you in any better movie where she would simply be a decently amusing villain but here its only her presence that can lighten up the screen somewhat hathaways beauty is worth admiring but the white queen would be better left in a poster as the moment she starts speaking or moving it is so unnatural word cringy does not do it justice the others are not even worth the mention with the exception of the caterpillar where rickmans charisma cannot be so subdued that it would not shine throughat many points in this movie i tried to tell myself \u2013 this is a movie for children what do you expect well much more there are many wonderful childrens movies that are delightful to watch for audiences of all ages this leaves you a feeling you just spent 2 hours watching the mardi gras carnival at 4 am where beautiful clad dancers barely even move anymore their steps mechanical and their eyes glazed over and the audience too drunk to carei went with a friend who said she loved it as it looked nice if this is all you are looking for and if you watch it while playing your favourite album on your mp3 player so as to limit your experience to moving images you might just find it enjoyable enough", "the good it did not give me cancerthe bad alice in wonderland is a treasure of classic literature and classic disney well it was that all changed with the latest abortion by tim burton aiw was easily the lamest contrived nonsensical piece of crap that has ever made me want to gouge my eyes out whilst watching it and i use the above terms of nonsensical and lame in the most disrespectful ways possible gone was the innocence whimsy curiosity and dare i say magic of the novel and the disney animated classic in its place a wooden funny looking actress whose range of emotions went from oh a fly just landed on my plate to oh a dog and its brown those last two situations didnt actually occur however they may have been more interesting than what hadi am literally shocked how one could take a piece of literature and film in numerous outings and turn it to that is beyond my level of comprehension this proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt that tim burton can no longer be regarded as a genius or even a competent storyteller he has become a quirky nightmare with a lot of money and fantastic art director to boot johnny depp has become an unwatchable characterization of himself a bad parody that seriously needs to stop and much like the director needs to get back the formula of ed wood and edward scissorhands im blown away by how poor this film was i went in with zero expectations and it surpassed them in a negative sense in a rating of 1 to 10 i give this film a burial at sea so no one can urinate on it any more than tim burton already has oh and avril lavine does the end music she is to art what small pox is to life let me add i get it it was supposed to be a follow up or sequel or something along those lines something of an homage piece if you will this was not executed in the least the dialog was barely audible and both mixed and pronounced to the poorest degree the plot was quick the inside jokes quicker and hackney the plot spoon fed and completely forced this film disgusts me its everything wrong with modern hollywood cinema directed at a younger generation and even to my own once again a treasured tale from youth and fond cinematic memory now has an blemish thanks to this tim burton needs to stop adapting loved literature like now the ugly i sort of wish it gave me cancer so if and when they do make a gaspsequel id be dead long before the trailer came out or would at least have bigger problems on my hands", "this is probably one of the most disappointing movies i have seen in a few years alice in wonderland should have been something up tim burtons alley and instead he turned it into something it wasnt he should have taken over the screenplay from linda woolverton whoever that is and created darker more dimensional characters instead what we get is tim burton for kids i would have preferred his take on lewis carrolls novel rather than a rehash of every hollywood fantasy film i thought the younger alice in the film looked the part of the original illustrations and would have been perfect for the role depp ruined the mad hatter with his accent and incoherent speech burton ruined the mad hatter with his ugly costume design i was disappointed to not hear hatter shout change places i understand he is saddened by resent events but even a mumbled sad change places would have been nice to hear and keep his character intact through a simple and effective effortthe charm behind carrolls novel is that there really isnt much of a story but rather a series of random and always bizarre events that are colorful and imaginative you start to gain the sense that alice really is in a peculiar land and at times you even often pity her with her return to wonderland the life behind everything the novel created almost evaporated i say almost because the cheshire cat steals the show and truly did save the the film regardless i would have much preferred a stop motion attempt the nightmare before christmas from tim burton rather than the use of actors and actresses to portray carrolls characters what were left with because of this is unnecessary though beautiful cgi and a lot of it at the very least the mood atmosphere of edward scissorhands would have been a delightful treat"], "sentiment": 0.07648463890139472, "tmdb_review": "i loved the movie of

the original movie though the montage in the movie looks nice when they did the flashback i love the colors anne hathaway is great i felt like watching a real life disney princess of course helena bonham carter is magnificent with her big head that looks really natural it adds to her funny character and then theres alan rickman although hes just a voice of the caterpillar once you hear his

to write the 234th comment on the shawshank redemption i am not sure   almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said but like so many other people who wrote comments i was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption the only other movie i have ever seen that effects me as strongly is to kill a mockingbird both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched themi didnt intend to see this movie at all i do not like prison movies and i dont normally watch them i work at a branch library and one day as i was checking the shawshank redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me whenever i feel down or depressed i check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better at the time i thought that was very strange one day there was nothing on tv except things i absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that i had seen too many times already i remembered what she said so i watched it i have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showingno action no special effects   just men in prison uniforms talking to each otherthe shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen i do not judge it by its technical merits   i dont really care about that i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best the best movies are ones that touch the soul it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul", "in its oscar year shawshank redemption written and directed by frank darabont after the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king was nominated for seven academy awards and walked away with zero best picture went to forrest gump while shawshank and pulp fiction were just happy to be nominated of course hindsight is 20 20 but while history looks back on gump as a good film pulp and redemption are remembered as some of the all time best pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at cannes and making its writer director an american master after only two films for andy dufresne and co success didnt come easy fortunately failure wasnt a life sentenceafter opening on 33 screens with take of $727327 the $25m film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $283m the reasons for failure are many firstly the title is a clunker while iconic to fans today in 1994 people knew not and cared not what a shawshank was on the dvd tim robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that rickshaw movie marketing wise the films a nightmare as prison drama is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends doesnt spell winner to men worst of all the movie is slow as molasses as desson thomson writes for the washington post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale but it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strongfirstly its setting the opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye opener this is an amazing piece of architecture strong and gothic in design immediately the prison becomes a character it casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot it towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world only andy robbins holds onto hope its in music its in the sandy beaches of zihuatanejo in heres where you need it most he says you need it so you dont forget forget that there are places in the world that arent made out of stone that theres a   theres a   theres something inside thats yours that they cant touch red morgan freeman doesnt think much of andy at first picking that tall glass o milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack andy says not a word and losing his bet red resents him for it but over time as the two get to know each other they quickly become the best of friends this again is one of the films major strengths many movies are about love many flicks have a side kick to the hero but shawshank is the only one i can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends it seems odd that hollywood would skip this relationship time and again when its a feeling that weighs so much into everyones day to day lives perhaps its too sentimental to seem conventional but shawshanks core friendship hits all the right notes and the film is much better for itits pacing is deliberate as well as we spend the film watching the same actors it is easy to forget that the movies timeline spans well over 20 years such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality and would only be amplified in prison and its not as if the film lacks interest in these moments it still knows where its going it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there it pays off as well as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating for anyone who sees it it is a moment never to be forgottenwith themes of faith and hope there is a definite religious subtext to be found here quiet selfless and carefree andy is an obvious christ figure warden norton bob gunton is obviously modeled on richard nixon who in his day was as close to a personified satan as they come but if you arent looking for subtexts the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope it is a compelling drama and a very moving film perfectly written acted and shot they just dont come much better than thisoverall score 98 10 = a+ the shawshank redemption served as a message of hope to hollywood as well more than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office besting forrest and fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995 it currently sits at #2 in the imdbs top 250 films occasionally swapping spots with the godfather as the top ranked film of all time    redemption indeed if you havent seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for as andy says it comes down a simple choice really either get busy living or get busy dying", "i have never seen such an amazing film since i saw the shawshank redemption shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams  and what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope  even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going throughit is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message  frank darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him  why this movie didnt win all seven oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the imdbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway youset aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie  you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie", "this movie is not your ordinary hollywood flick it has a great and deep message this movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hopeother than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal tim robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever he was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive his performance just made me smile robbins plays andy dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover he is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope in he becomes friends with ellis boyd red redding played by morgan freeman freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike robbins lost hope he is in deep regret of the crime that he committed his way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all with his friendship with andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing andy also becomes friends with the rest of reds group james whitmore also gave a great performance as brooks halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of red he has been institutionalized the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent he kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography he portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever it has everything you could possibly want", "the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption starring tim robbins and morgan freeman the film portrays the story of andy dufresne robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker however the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of themthere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office however come academy award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release the rest as they say is history for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors one thing is for sure though is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go awayits possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion but when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith the sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist cosy prison life you say no chance the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely and given the quite terrific performances of robbins never better & freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and redthose in support arent faring too bad either bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton james whitmore is heart achingly great as the birdman of shawshank clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt byron hadley william sadler amusing as heywood & mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond then theres roger deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too thomas newmans score is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozartif you love shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime every viewing brings the same array of emotions   anger   revilement   happiness   sadness   inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment above all else though shawshank offers hope   not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us 10 1", "can hollywood usually creating things for entertainment purposes only create art  to create something of this nature a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process  such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films the most prominent music visuals script and acting these elements each equally important must succeed independently yet still form a harmonious union because this mixture determines the fate of the artists opus  though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing frank darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut the shawshank redemption  proving himself already a master of the craft darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of hollywood  the shawshank redemption defines a genre defies the odds compels the emotions and brings an era of artistically influential films back to hollywoodthe story begins with the trial of a young banker andy dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover  after a quick conviction andy finds himself serving a life sentence at shawshank prison with no hope of parole  he exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him  his ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from ellis redding  ellis commonly referred to as red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison  andys demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him  andy proves to red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyleby creating the films firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this films success  frank darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of stephen kings equally noteworthy novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption  in this novella king demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature  though the film mirrors the novella in many ways darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions everwhile maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella darabont also proves that a films score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does  he employs the cunning thomas newman son of the legendary hollywood composer alfred newman  darabont shows recognition for the films needs by employing newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue  newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition  his effort in shawshank did not go unnoticed as his score received an oscar nomination in 1995  while unique and independent newmans score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the filmwith work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other hollywood artists the cast of the shawshank redemption had a strong foundation to work with  the marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film  while both tim robbins and morgan freeman shine as andy and red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles  most noticeable of these the veteran film star james whitmore who portrays the elderly brooks hatlen  brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the shawshank and the daily life he has lead  each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievablewith all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom  these themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story  though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date  like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience  darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think  he leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seekthis film manages to redeem hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich\u00e9s and predictability  darabont shows us that artists still work in the hollywood studios and production facilities these artists show their capability to produce art real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you  the shawshank redemption delivers much needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film  it proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget", "im trying to save you money this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing renting shawshank will cost you five bucks just plunk down the $25 and own the title youll wind up going back to this gem time and time again this is one of few movies that are truly timeless and its entertaining and moving no matter how many times you view itforget about what others including myself might suggest youll discover in the shawshank redemption when you watch it youll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene a character or a moment in this uncomplicated movie when you need hope youll look for shawshank when you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles shawshank will uplift you in ways that you cant find in movies today some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening of course some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and faith in humanity but most places of worship are open only certain days or times but when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances shawshank will give it to you it makes grown men like me cry still i wonder whether shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward nominated for seven this is the best film that never one a single oscar how ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system shawshank itself is similar to the character of andy dufresne prejudging this classic film critics couldnt get past the title the public followed suit initially dismissing shawshank which failed in the box office just like its a wonderful life and citizen kane it could have just whithered away on the store shelves like andy dufresne could have in his own cell but the characters prevailed because andy    and shawshank    stayed true now these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time anyone who has yet to watch shawshank may be so jaded of movies or the films title or how a 2 1 2  hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people shawshank has not one explosion i wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally  enhanced frame but every aspect of shawshank fit together the acting from the top to the bit part the musical score the editing the photography the story from opening credits to final scene all involved including the town of mansfield ohio where shawshank was actually filmed played their roles perfectly shawshank is a must  see must  own title", "ive lost count of the number of times i have seen this movie but it is more than 20 it has to be one of the best movies ever made it made me take notice morgan freeman and tim robbins like i had never noticed any actors beforei have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything stephen king writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movienot everything stephen king has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a moviesomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action no special effects and no gimmicks 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the endfor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout the never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by tim robbins the ending is just spine tingling every time i see it no matter how many times i have seen itbrilliant brilliant movie and a must see for everyone", "misery and stand by me were the best adaptations up until this one now you can add shawshank to that listthis is simply one of the best films ever made and i know i am not the first to say that and i certainly wont be the last the standing on the imdb is a true barometer of that #3 as of this date and im sure it could be number 1 so ill just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is but let me perhaps add that what i find so fascinating about shawshank is that stephen king wrote itking is one of the best writers in the world books like it and the castle rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told but his best adaptations are always done by the best directors the shining was brilliantly interpreted by kubrick and of course the aforementioned misery and stand by me are both by rob reiner now frank darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best king film ever he seems to understand what king wants to say and he conveys that beautifully what makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys it is one of eternal hope andy dufresne played by tim robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit but he never loses hope he never gives up his quest to become a free man again his years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live this film has a different feel to it there has never been anything like it before and i dont know if there will againim not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that i am glad that forrest gump won best picture in 94 i would have been equally glad if pulp fiction or shawshank would have won it is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come", "one of the finest films made in recent years its a poignant story about hope hope gets me thats what makes a film like this more than a movie it tells a lesson about life those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you its also a story for freedom freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate freeman and robbins are majestic in their performances each learns from the other their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another there is also a wonderful performance from legend james whitmore as brookshe shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink stephen kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement it is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years", "the reason i became a member of this database is because i finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie there  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema   i believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times on first viewing it is the story of  andy dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances   however this is really a movie about red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose the final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when red is faced with the same fearful situation as brooks because of andy red can find a different path the path of freedom that is lit by hope  who is your andy dufresne", "whenever i talk about this movie with my friends i do not even refer to it by title but rather as the movie  when i say the movie my friends know exactly what im talking about  in fact the main reason that me and my friends dont refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain i still remember the first time i saw the shawshank redemption  some friends of mine and i went to see it at one of those budget theaters over the summer of 1995  none of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good  so not having any real expectations we saw it  when the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor i turned my head towards my friend bob and said that was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my entire life theres really no other way i can put it in words  every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life hope  this movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny at the right times jaw dropping and heart warming all at the same time  i get chills every time i watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending which takes place over the last 30 minutes or soin movie history  how it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting i should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that i know i will never see a better movie no matter how many i may see  ive seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films  however every time i walk out of the theater i turn to my friend or family member that i saw it with and i say that was a great movie but it wasnt nearly as good as you know what  there have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that i might one day call my favorite of all time but theyve all fallen far short of the shawshank redemption so if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately  youre guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section and if it isnt in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them  if you have seen this movie go see it again  if you havent bought your own copy yet buy one in fact buy two and put one in a fire proof safe just in case of an emergency o so you want a 1 10 rating  i give it a 13", "i watch this movie for minimum 5 6 times first to last so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time its a piece of art and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play acting casting background scoring editing etc this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake", "the shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen similar to the green mile in many respects and better than it in almost all of them these two movies have shown us that stephen king is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart the plot is average but king did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so top rate its almost scarytim robbins plays andy dufrane wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife the story focuses on andys relationship with red redding morgan freeman in probably his best role and his attempts to escape from shawshank bob gunton is positively evil and frightening as warden norton and there are great performances and cameos all around the most prominent one being gil bellows late as billy of ally mcbeal as tommy a fellow inmate of andys who suffers under the iron will of nortonif you havent seen this movie go and rent it now you will not be disappointed it is positively the best movie of the 90s and one of my top 3 of all time this movie is a spectacle to move the mind soul and heart 10 1", "my life is forever changed due to this movie  it is a movie of hope redemption and friendship  it shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners andy and red  they each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at shawshank prison  as time passes hope wanes but a flame burns bright in andy  his hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend redas reds long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel  andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom and he follows itthis film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light  for some of those people time will tell  as for now ill be patient to wait and see  dont end up like brooks there will always be someone to help you out  there is someone out there that cares for you  thank you andy dufresne your hope is the flame of my life", "it has a formula that gives you this kick darn what a good movie but i need to say this sometimes it happens so why do people love this movie and rate it high when or why isnt the smart people declare it like a a peace of art or do they still i think its darn goodbut i bet the producers didnt expect thatlike when we vote for anything we need to follow our heart this is a typical movie that is worth every penny every letter and its a typical 90 movie oh there we have it between gone with the wind and now we need this love me as i am says the storyline in my head anyway and i do yes i do", "three words oh my godhow am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words i dont know but ill give it a shot here goesthis movie is just bloody excellent brilliant fantastic unbelievable not a thing wrong with it shocking in a good way heck pretty much every single good comment word you can think ofi mean for gods sake its so damn good it takes your breath away i seriously could not speak after it it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow and thats saying something as i have seen some pretty excellent filmstheres not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap standouts are morgan freeman tim robbins and the dude who plays brooksi could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie but unfortunately i havent got that much space and my fingers would get sorean absolute must see for everyone and im positive that ill never see another movie better than this and this will stay at #1 on my list forever", "i believe that this film is the best story ever told on film and im about to tell you whytim robbins plays andy dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover he is sent to shawshank prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime andy forms an unlikely friendship with red morgan freeman the man who knows how to get things andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes the story unfoldsi was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director the acting was world class i have never seen tim robbins act as well since morgan freeman maybe eg seven the twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or cliched it was original the cinematography was grand and expressive it gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prisonbut the one thing which makes the shawshank redemption stand above all other films is the attention given to the story the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels its a powerful poignant thought provoking challenging film like no other if andy were to comment on this film i think he might say get busy watching or get busy dying take his advicethoroughly recommended", "when i first see it i am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us the film gave me a very different feeling hope is a dangerous thing is the root of mental distress because since come in the day the warden said the soul to god the body to meexcept that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed cards and any other changes i cant seem to grow within the walls of the dark however andy told him remember hope is a good thing   and perhaps even good and no good thing will never disappear so andy can use 20 years digging red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundredwhen he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes standing in the pouring rain cant help we seem to see faith pierce heavy darkness played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blueunder the light the soul of our weak under andy with open arms in the sky in succession and shaking", "this movie is one of my all time favorites undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen story cast screenplay all are great the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate it was narrated by morgan freeman who is the best narrator in hollywood i believe actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels it will change the way u think about things around u surely it will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hopei can say with confidence this is the best movie i have ever seen   or ever will see if you havent watch it yet just go watch it now", "the shawshank redemption is a timeless story of heartbreak deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions the acting is superior some of tim robbins and morgan freemans best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convicts existence where i am torn emotionally between danger and safety light and shadow sanity and sorrow truth and lies injustice and justice in fact i am lost in all the actors poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs cruel guards swindlers thieves rapists and murders all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yardin this movie i find almost no one to be all good or all bad there are exceptions though although there are those in charge of the prison i wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes i cheer on to win in the end like people in real life most of the characters in the shawshank redemption both prisoners and guards those that are not miserably rotten to the bone represent many shades of grayone of the most touching moments in the shawshank redemption is a scene in which an elderly convict who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories and his fear of this new and unnatural terrain crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past engulfed him with no hope of ever escapingfear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free from the shawshank redemptionas bonds form between people of different ethnic groups economic backgrounds and intellectual levels i rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share as the story unfolds my heart hurts so hard i cry then with tears still in my eyes i laugh the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when i was a little girlgetting older times changing people leaving dying but at the core of the main characters spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range including me a contagious hope eternal i am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time i view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit", "it is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me watching very very impressed what it might be called the great stories of stephen king anyway acting on cues can say is enormous theres no posturing especially when andy dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyones lips finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into finals if he so exhilarating you a high quality music and finding that deserves really deserve i watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way this film is one of the reasons i hate the oscars will remain as the best film in more than 10 years i believe wholeheartedly sites definitely one of the best films in the world", "**yes there are spoilers here**this film has had such an emotional impact on me i find it hard to write comments on it  ive read a lot of the previous comments all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think its over rated or cliched most have got good points to make however the thing that i think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved  loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a filmso im not going to review it im just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film  it took me a few viewings to get why i connect with it so deeply but here goesmany people in this world are unhappy  most people in this world dont want to be unhappy  lots of people wish pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears losses angers and pains once and for all  they see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state while they suffer  to borrow the words of another film theyre watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbowmany unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesnt exist theyre not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales dont come true  its not that no one lives happily ever after its just that theyre not going to theyre busy dyingin this film or as some people have quite correctly said this fairytale magic wands exist  and that magic wand is andy dufrense imitating houdini however this film is not about him  neither is it about the prison the governor the guard the plot the acting the cinematography the script the direction or the scoreits about red  he is the one who has become institutionally unhappy hes not only trapped in a prison not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving not only does he have no hope he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him he couldnt cope  hes safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going  hope is as red say dangerous  the metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and i know that a rather large number of people suffer from it  a large proportion of those dont understand whats wrong but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer  those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely dont understand whats going on in those who do  theyre too busy livingthe miracle in this film is not only that red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isnt all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing  some of it is rocky and uncertain  fairytales dont get this far theyd end as red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say and he lived happily ever after  this is the only film i can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store  in other words theyre not going to cheat you and tell you everythings going to be alrightthis is crucial  for two and half hours those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to andys mapped out on the screen  and its a real way out its hard and upsetting but ultimately rewarding  the high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphinethe trouble is if youre already busy living this film wont mean that much and youll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying  to those fortunate individuals watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going throughso yes this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isnt realistic and at second on the imdb all time list it is a bit over rated however if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved altered and improved the shawshank redemption would be way out in front at number one", "one of my favorite movies everthe shawshank redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes placebased on a stephen king novelthis movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic filmtim robbins stars as andy dufresne who is convicted of murder and morgan freeman as ellis boyd red redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of dufresne and bob gunton as warden samuel norton who is the warden of shawshank state prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despisethis film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and i definitely agree with this factit was nominated for seven academy awards including best picture best actor \u0096 morgan freeman best adapted screenplay best cinematography best editing best original score and best sound but didnt win any due to tough competition from the film forrest gumpi personally think that tim robbins should have been nominated for the best actor award as he really gave the performance of his careerbravo to this brilliant modern day classic", "we have all see movies comedies action and dramas we all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it in shawshank redemption you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics i felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of i felt i was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfiedthis movie must be used as an anti depression by therapists this movie proves that oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any oscar to the shawshank redemption knowing that the movie is on different   much higher  rating scale than the oscars its simply over qualified"], "sentiment":
